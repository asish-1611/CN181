Problem Title: Language Learning App
Problem Statement:
Learning a new language can be challenging, especially without access to personalized learning resources and interactive practice opportunities. 
Traditional language learning methods often lack flexibility and fail to adapt to individual learning styles. Your task is to develop a language 
learning application that provides users with interactive lessons, practice exercises, and feedback to enhance their language skills in an 
engaging and effective manner.
